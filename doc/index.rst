Introduction
============

Ohmcha is a **free** program used for creating, calculating and simulating
electrical circuits. There are a lot of free circuit simulators out there, but
most of them are either of low quality, scarcely featured, or not very
extensible.

Ohmcha aims to be extensible, hackable, efficient and feature-rich, while still
respecting the Unix philosophy as much as possible. It has both a GUI and CLI
interface, because what good is a program if you can't automate tasks in it
using scripts?

Ohmcha is completely open source.
It is written in C++.
Some parts (mostly related to GUI) are written using Qt.

Features

* Many customization options
* Support for various file formats
